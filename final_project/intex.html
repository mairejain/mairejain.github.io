  <h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>I am a Detroit native (born and raised).  My family is from Italy (Reggio Calabira, specifically).  I speak Italian, but only a slang dialect called 'Calabrese.'
  A little known fact about me is that I am a washed-up rapper.  For those of you who don't know what this means, I had a record deal and it went flat.  I made the deadly mistake of signing all three contracts with the same entity, which meant that this company controlled everything, including sub-contract negotiations.  I was slated to open up for Mariah Carey and Slick Rick, but my management company rejected the deal (something I would not have done).
I have not opened up for may super-famous people, but here's the short list:
 </p>
 <ul id="first-list">
   <li>Markey-Mark and the Funky Bunch</li>
   <li>MC Eiht & Compton's Most Wanted</li>
   <li>MC Breed</li>
 </ul>
 <p>I have met many famous people, including superstars in both rap and R&B.  Here's a list of those people:
</p>
<ul id="second-list">
  <li>Babyface</li>
  <li>Kid & Play</li>
  <li>Kool Moe Dee</li>
  <li>Aaron Hall (from Guy)</li>
  <li>Betty Wright</li>
  <li>Kurtis Blow (he was my producer)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you have enjoyed getting to learn about me.  I don't share this information with may people.  And, yes, I do miss performing.  (And giving out autographs!)</p>
